# Summer_project_cpp
This repository contains a simple console-based implementation of the classic Hangman game, developed as a summer project using C++. The game allows players to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses before losing.

Features:
Randomly selected words from a predefined list
Tracks correct and incorrect guesses
Simple user interface using console input/output
Game-over condition when the player exceeds the maximum number of wrong guesses
Displays the word progressively as correct letters are guessed
This project helped me reinforce fundamental C++ concepts such as control structures, functions, arrays, and string manipulation.
